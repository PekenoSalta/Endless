# Endless
 Endless (non-definitive name) is a role-playing and medieval fantasy made in JAVA to one day be an Android APP with its development in 2D.
  
We start with the basis of a simple mini-game where two characters are engaged in a battle for their life. From there we will build a world full of enemies and an amazing lore around Endless, a kingdom full of life and mystery.
